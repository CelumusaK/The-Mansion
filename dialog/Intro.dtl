Many souls are trapped in this cursed mansion—Edith’s domain.
Her undead spirit roams here, bound to a cursed mirror inside the mansion.
Find it.
Shine that holy torch in your hand on it for 10 seconds to break her hold and escape.
Tip\: She hates her reflection.
Once the most beautiful, now a hideous monster.
Hold a mirror, a light, and she won’t dare attack.
There are mirrors scattered around somwhere .
Hurry—save the souls suffering.
